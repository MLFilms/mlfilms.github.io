Jeff is a physics PhD candidate at CU Boulder, where he studies nonequilibrium dynamics in the context of biological active matter. As a computational physicist, he writes his own Brownian dynamics simulations to model the physical systems in his research, and analyzes his results using statistical methods in Python.

Jeff has been interested in machine learning since 2017, and has taken classes in statistical modeling and Bayesian inference at the university to supplement his self-study of machine learning from resources online. He is expecting to graduate in May 2020 and pursue a career in data science.
