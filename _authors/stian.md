Stian has completed a Bachelors of Science degree of Engineering Physics, and two minors in Computer science and Applied Mathematics at University of Colorado Boulder. He is currently on an unintential gap year before looking into Masters and/or PhD programs. 

  He is interested in simulation and computational mathematics, and is interested in working in industry after completing his schooling over the next couple years. In the mean time he is looking for work to do, and potentially taking a couple months to find a sailboat to crew on before starting on graduate school.
