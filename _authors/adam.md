Adam has the dubious distinction of being the oldest graduate student in the lab. Faced with the prospect of counting thousands (millions) of defects by hand to finish his PhD, he instead hopped on the hype-train that is machine learning to hopefully do it for him. We will see if this gamble pays off.

He has a background in both experimental and computational physics, and is currently writing his thesis, which focusses on the behaviour of quasi-2D liquid films. You can track his progress writing said thesis on github.
