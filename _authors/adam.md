Adam is a PhD candidate at the University of Colorado Boulder in the field of experimental soft-matter (liquid crystal physics). As part of his thesis, he discovered two new phases of [matter](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.122.107801) and designed a new type of [flowmeter](http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.5083967). His latest project involved tracking the statistics of topological defects in high-speed video microscopy, which, using traditional methods, would involve hand tagging thousands of defects. The realization that modern machine learning methods are uniquely suited to this challenge was the inspiration behind this project--- which is looking at the efficacy of machine learning methods to analyze experimental data. 

He has a background in both experimental and computational physics, and is currently leading this project and writing his thesis, which focusses on the behaviour of quasi-2D liquid films. You can track his progress writing said thesis on [github](https://github.com/aasgreen/thesis).

He is expecting to graduate August 2019, and is actively looking for opportunities in industry with focus on data science. You can follow him on his personal [blog](https://adamasgreen.com).
