Adam is a PhD candidate at the University of Colorado Boulder in the field of soft-matter (liquid crystal physics). Faced with the prospect of counting thousands (millions) of defects by hand to finish his PhD, he instead hopped on the hype-train that is machine learning to hopefully do it for him. We will see if this was a wise decision.

He has a background in both experimental and computational physics, and is currently writing his thesis, which focusses on the behaviour of quasi-2D liquid films. You can track his progress writing said thesis on github.

He is actively looking for opportunities in industry with focus on data science. You can follow him on his personal [blog](https://adamasgreen.com)
