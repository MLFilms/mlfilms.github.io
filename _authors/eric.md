Eric is a recent graduate of the University of Colorado Boulder, graduating Summa Cum Laude with distinction with degrees in Physics, Computer Science and Mathematics. He has worked for the past two years in the Liquid Crystal Films Lab at the CU Boulder Soft Materials Research Center,  designing and implementing software to efficiently analyze video data from experiments conducted aboard the International Space Station and terrestrially. 



He has been the primary engineer responsible for designing the SETT system, which massively simplifies the process of enhancing simulated images, training YOLO models on those enhanced simulation images, and then validating those models against real-world experimental images. He hopes the system will make the benefits of machine learning systems for computer vision more accessible to groups without advanced machine learning expertise.
