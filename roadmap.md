## thesis
*To test machine learning techniques to experimental image analysis.* 

**statement 1\|** The machine learning renissonce has given machines the ability to analyze complicated data sets (such as images) and extract useful information (see facial recognition). Success of these methods depends on having large sets of training data.

**statement 2\|** Experimental results from table-top physical experiments are rarely large or robust enough to form self-consistant training sets, so experimental analysis in physics remains a 'bespoke' process, requiring a craftsperson (graduate student) to analyze each set of data by hand.

**statement 3\|** Physical systems can often be simulated to high-accuracy using modern computing resources.

**proposal\|** For certain physical systems, training sets can be generated by physical simulations of the system of interest. These training sets can be fed into modern machine learning algorithms to produce robust analysis models, resulting in greater bandwidth for experimental analysis.


## Science Plan

**experimental system of interest**


Two-dimensional topological films...

**stage 0: up and running**
1. collect data from experimenal system
2. generate simulated training sets
3. choose machine learning paradigm
4. establish machine learning pipeline (simulation (generate images)-> machine learning (train model)-> verification (verify on experimental data)
5. documentation/reproducibility (docker, website)


**stage 1: refinement**
1. add noise into simulation image set 
2. experiment with parameters to achieve best accuracy of model
3. add filtering step onto pipeline to clean up spurious detections

**stage 2: application**
1. apply pipeline to system of interest to generate novel results
