In the previous post, [[link]], we talked about our realization of the XY-model, tilted, smectic liquid crystals. In this post, we'll go into a little more detail about the XY-model, and how it ties in with machine learning.

The XY model is a simple model to describe. First, picture a grid.

Now, at every point on the grid, we put a little arrow, denoting the spin at that location.

That is it. This is the foundation of the XY model. It is admittedly pretty boring though. The next step is to have these spins interact with themselves. A natural choice for interaction is that the spins want to be aligned (ferroelectric ordering). We also demand that the interaction is hyper-local: every spin can only interact with its nearest neighbors. The simplest mathematical realization of this is the interaction potential:


$$
H = \sum_{i,j}^N s_i \cdot s_j = \sum_{i,j}^N \cos(\theta_i -\theta_j)
$$

However, because all the spins are pointing in the same direction, this system has the lowest energy possible, so it's not very exciting. We can randomize the system, so that every point has a spin at some random direction.

We can also plot the energy of the system: at every grid site, we can solve for what the interaction energy is:

You'll notice, I was also sneaky and colour-coded the spins in the XY-grid picture, where the colour reflects how much interaction energy they have.


## Vortices in the XY-Model
One of the main things that is interesting about the XY model is that it supports vortices. Vortices are easier to talk about in the continuous version of the xy model. So imagine we take our grid, and take the limit of lattice spacing to zero-- boom, we're now in a continuous space[:1]. How does our interaction energy change? Ask any physicist a question and they'll suggest Taylor expansion, so that's what we'll do. But I don't want to write out all the tex, so you can trust
me that in a continuous space, our interaction energy (to first order anyway) becomes:
$$
h = \left( /nabla \theta\ \right )^2.
$$

Now, we're trying to get to a pithy explanation of what a vortex is. Taking a very broad outlook, a vortex is a certain spatial configuration of spins. Armed now with our hamiltonian, we can begin looking at what spatial configurations are allowed by the XY interaction. To do that, we'll do the usually physics sleight of hand by pretending that $$h$$ is a free-energy, and take the functional dervivative to find the minimum free-energy state. Doing that, we get:
$$
\frac{\delta h}{\delta \theta(x,y)} \propto \nabla^2 \theta(x,y)
$$

Oh, it's a Laplacian. That is comforting, now we can call Daddy-Maxwell and get him to solve this without breaking a sweat. Remembering the week we covered 2D electrostatics in Griffiths, we know that a solution to this equation is the point-charge potential:
$$
\theta(x,y) \propto \frac{q}{r}
$$

The point-charges in the $$\theta(x,y)$$ field are vortices! Like point-charges, they are local divergences in the field.


But, the grid automatically save us from spatial divergences. Unfortunately, because of that, we don't have a snappy explanation for what a vortex is, and instead have to rely on homotopy theory, which I don't have time to go into any real depth on. But what follows is a hand-wavy alogorithm.


For our grid, a vortex is any plaquette where, when you walk around the perimiter in a counter-clock wise direction, adding up the spin at every grid point as you go, you'll get a value whose magnitude is greater than 2Ï€. The sign of the value you get tells you the charge of the defect.

We can demonstrate on our random spin-grid.
